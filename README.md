Friend Finder is a matching app, similar to a dating app. There is a 10 question survey and at the end, the closest match is displayed.

I created this app for UCLA bootcamp.

List of technologies / tools used in the app:

JavaScript
Node.js
Bash
NPM Packages: Express(for routing)
Heroku
JSON
APIs (creation)
